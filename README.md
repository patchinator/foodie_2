## Fuctionality

A platform to post, comment and like other people's food-related experiences.

## Learning

This was the second time using Chakra UI. It's brilliant documentation and usability
makes creating reactive components simple and scalable.

This was the first proper project using the Next.js framework. I found it's routing
and server side rendering features extremely useful.
